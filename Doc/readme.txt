F4/FMPAC Combo Board version 1.3

Notes
-----

The F4 Register part of the board is optional. It is only needed when the board is being installed into a computer that is converted
to MSX2+. Normal MSX1 or MSX2 computers don't need F4 port.

This FMPAC board does not support writing anything to SRAM (there's no SRAM on board). Also this device only provides mono sounds
and music. Stereo is not available.

Please note that the provided FMPAC ROM image doesn't contain the user interface part. So starting it with _FMPAC or _JPPAC commands
will result in system crash. The full version of the FMPAC is available in the RBSC's Carnivore2 cartridge. The user interface there
is also translated into English.
