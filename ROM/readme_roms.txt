The combined.rom file contains both internal and external FMPAC ROMs. The internal.rom file contains only the internal FMPAC
ROM file. It is recommended to use the internal ROM file for this board.

If you are using a 64kb EPROM chip, append combined.rom file to itself so it gets double in size and write it to the chip.

See the readme.txt file for more info.
